                Some may find this odd, but I love working in JavaScript. It is such a versatile language! It has all
                the power of a back-end language, yet one can directly use it to manipulate the UI. You can make things
                spin around the page and create all kinds of animations. You can make things happen directly on the page
                without having to refresh the page. You can create games! Oh, can you create games!
            </p>

                I will admit it, when I first began coding in JavaScript, I found it difficult and frustrating compared
                to other languages. It is called the "wild west" of languages for a reason. There are so many unexpected
                and difficult errors that can happen. The functions and variables do not require types, so the error
                messages give you little information about what goes wrong at times. When first learning, I would add so
                many console log messages just to figure out what was going on, because often, I didn't even know where
                the errors were occurring in the code. It was a struggle to learn, yet rewarding in the end.

                Once I finally understood most of the ins and outs of JavaScript, however, it transformed into the most
                freeing, fun language I have ever written in. I soon went on to create all sorts of games with it. I
                realized there is just so much you can do! Trust me, it is a language worth learning, you just have to
                stick it out until you reach a level where you can do whatever you want with it!

                Hello, my name is Harley and I am one of the rare women who enjoys coding. This is my first blog post,
                so I figured I should tell you a little about my background.
            </p>

                I have been fascinated by computers since age 4 when my grandpa started teaching me to use his brand new
                Windows 95 desktop computer and teaching me how to type. I learned to do this through elementary school
                as well. When I was about 11 years old, my grandpa bought a new desktop and we got the internet for the
                first time. Living with my grandparents and being an only child, I spent a lot of time on the internet,
                especially on a website called NeoPets.com. It was here that I first started to learn how to code web
                pages for my virtual pets. NeoPets offered information on how kids can start learning to code, so I did
                just that. I found it so much fun and so fascinating to be able to create my own web page! Back then, we
                didn't use a lot of CSS. HTML actually had a syntax to change text color, size, background color, etc.
                right inside of the tags. (I realize you can still do this with the "style" tag, but you can no longer
                do it the way you once could.)
            </p>

                Throughout middle school and high school, I continued learning to code, both on my own and through
                classes. I took a web design course where the teacher believed I was cheating because she thought my web
                page was too good, but in truth, I already knew how to do most of what was taught in the class. I also
                learned Adobe Flash and some of what was called "ActionScript". I learned and became proficient in Adobe
                PhotoShop as well, and in making games with a program called Game Maker. I learned a language called
                "Visual Basic" in another class, which first introduced me to back-end programming. My senior year of
                high school, I took a college-level, year-long course about programming and the language of Python. I
                was the only girl in the class, but I excelled. I finished the lessons so quickly that I went on to
                create my own games and programs and began tutoring the other students in the class. At the end of the
                year, the teacher gave me an award for "Most Outstanding Programmer".

                That was all the way back in 2009. Through most of my 20s, I mostly had fun, to be honest. I was focused
                on creating art and with having my laptop stolen, I stopped programming for quite a while. Toward the
                end of my 20s though, after failing to make a living as an artist, I learned that developers make good
                money and remembered that I once had a passion for this. That was when I completed a JAVA coding boot
                camp and obtained my first job as a developer. I worked with back-end languages like C# and SQL, but
                also taught myself JavaScript on the side. I realized that I greatly enjoy languages like this, so I
                transitioned to working more in the UI as a React developer. I enjoyed this sweet spot between the
                back-end and front-end where I can utilize both my creativity and problem-solving skills.
            </p>
            <p class="post-content">
                In the end, I wanted to move back home, but struggled to find another developer job here with only a
                boot camp certificate and associate's degree, so I am now completing my bachelor's at MSU. I cannot wait
                to get back to being a developer!
