        <p>
            My name is Harley Johnson and I am older than in this picture. I don't feel like taking a new one though. I
            am a
            software developer and an artist who is doing it all backwards by finishing school AFTER working her first
            developer job. I am finishing an Information Science degree as a student
            at Michigan State University. I already have a coding bootcamp certificate, 2 1/2 years of experience
            working
            as a full-stack developer, and plenty of years of learning to code on my own before I ever considered making
            it a career. It has been a life goal for about 10 years to go back and complete my degree, so I am doing
            just that. I
            have two cats and a boyfriend named Brian. I love to laugh, draw, and learn about anything and everything.
            Call me a nerd, I wear it proudly.
        </p>
        Some of my favorite foods:
        <ul>
            <li>Breakfast Burritos</li>
            <li>Chicken Caesar Salad</li>
            <li>Strawberries</li>
            <li>General Tso Chicken</li>
            <li>Egg Rolls</li>
            <li>Banana Bread</li>
            <li>Chicken Fajitas</li>
            <li>Lasagna</li>
            <li>Spicy California Roll</li>
            <li>BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwiches</li>
            <li>Special K Cereal</li>
            <li>Anything Chocolate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Alright, that was random. Anything else you would like to know, just ask me! I am an open book, so long as
            you don't want to know any personally identifiable information that could put me in danger or leave me open
            to identity theft. I assume you know that, though. Have a great day!
