        <p>My name is Harley Johnson and I am older than in this picture. I don't feel like taking a new one though. I
            am a
            software developer and an artist who is doing it all backwards by finishing school AFTER working her first
            developer job. I am finishing an Information Science degree as a student
            at Michigan State University. I already have a coding bootcamp certificate, 2 1/2 years of experience
            working
            as a full-stack developer, and plenty of years of learning to code on my own before I ever considered making
            it a career. It has been a life goal for about 10 years to go back and complete my degree, so I am doing
            just that. I
            have two cats and a boyfriend named Brian. I love to laugh, draw, and learn about anything and everything.
            Call me a nerd, I wear it proudly.</p>
